#This repo consists of all the important things which i felt worth notifying while learning dockers and containers
*********you should be aware of basic creation of containers using dockers , before you proceed further**************

1. ########## connecting between containers using Docker Compose ##########################

   * Docker Compose helps to start multiple containers and also helps in connecting the containers in an automated way which occurs in 
     background.
   * I have created two containers named redis and visits:
                  creation of redis directly from docker hub and just ran it
                  creation of visits container , : which ideally counts the number of visits to the webpage created
   * when i run the two containers , they dont know how to connect and ideally it does not work.
   * In order to make two containers to have networking between themselves , we need to use Docker-Compose tool , for this i have created
     docker-compose.yml file and made necessary configurations
 ***** you can look into visits directory in order to understand how connectivity of containers happened*****************
